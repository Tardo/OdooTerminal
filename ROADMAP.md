# Roadmap

```
- Solve some boostrap "glitches" printing error section in 11.0 (Because Terminal uses BS4 and 11.0 BS3)
- Remove extension storage data after uninstall (chrome doesn't have any 'event' to handle this)
- Use some kind of mock to cover all commands in tests (See Untested Commands section in docs/testing.md)
- What will happen when Odoo stops supporting the "new old" api?
- Explicity define the states for the state machine... sounds like a good idea uh?
- Use better english... and maybe support multi-language?
```
